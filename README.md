1. to change the order number from 5 to 6, we can calculate mock.data.length , it will then show the correct output
2. for table order submitted data to be shown, I have fetch it from timeStamps.json and displayed it over the table
3. for the dropdown menu, I have fetched the data from json files to display the data as per users choice
4. for searching purpose, I have first changed the text into lowercase and then filter method to get the id to be diplayed
5. to remove the error from console,I have used the index to give the unique value to all the row
6. to display the tables , I have fetched the data and also used css to make them together.
